## Predicting NBA Game Outcomes using a Statistical Model

### Data Source
To start off this project of creating a model to predict the outcome of games, I pulled the 2014-2015 NBA season from NBA.com's API.  This sample of 1,230 games was used for building of the model as well as the validation through cross validation.  The code used for creating this schedule is [here](updateme).

### Data Exploration
Picking the right variables is essential to improving the model's accuracy and resiliency.  The prominent variables for predicting a game's outcome are the "[Four Factors](http://www.basketball-reference.com/about/factors.html)."  Within a game, four factors are calculated per team: 

1. Shooting: eFG% = (FGM + 0.5*3PM) / FGA
2. Turnovers: TOV% = Turnovers / (FGA + 0.44*FTA + Turnovers)
3. Rebounding: ORB% = DRB / (Opp ORB + DRB)
4. Free Throws: FTFGA = FT/FGA


First, I wanted to see how these factors correlated with the game's outcome.  Using the NBA games listed above, I calculated the four factors for each game and looked at the results.  For each factor, the y-axis has the game outcome: 1 for wins and 0 for losses.  The red line connects the mean factor values for wins and losses, showing the directionality of the factor:

All four factors appear to have the right directionality with respect to the game outcome, so now it's time to plug these variables into a logistic regression model.

The model has a 10 fold cross-validated accuracy of 88%.  Not bad for just using 8 variables (each team has its Four Factors).  The cavaet is that these factors can't be calculated until the game is over, meaning that the in-game factors don't offer any predictive power.  For the game outcome model, we have to get predictions before the game starts, so we can't use the in-game Four Factors.  

We can, however, use a team's Four Factors in past games. 

To do: add rest of model design and results.

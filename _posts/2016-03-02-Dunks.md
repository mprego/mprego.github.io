##Analysis of Dunks and Game Outcomes


To represent dunks as a score, i’ve created a metric that rewards dunks and penalizes missed dunks:

- Dunk Score = Made Dunks - Missed Dunks (either by fault of offensive player or by defensive block)

Using shot analysis on NBA.com, this metric is tallied up for each team in each game in the 2014-2015 NBA season.  Looking at the Dunk Score vs the actual score, there is a slight correlation of 0.13 (Orange is home team and Blue is away team):

The team with the higher Dunk Score also has a higher probability of winning the game:

Even though these probabilities aren’t drastically different from 50/50, the Dunk Score provides additional predictive power when trying to predict the outcome of the game using additional metrics.
